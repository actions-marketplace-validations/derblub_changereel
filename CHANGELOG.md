# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

- `--narrate`: a local model in Ollama says in one sentence what each change is; the sentence is shown under the page.
- `--voice`: Piper speaks the sentences, and a scene lasts as long as its sentence.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-13

- Compares every route of two versions of a site and renders the changes as a video: the page before, a wipe to the page after, a frame around what differs.
- Pages are compared like text files whose lines are rows of pixels, so a new section is "added" and what it pushed down is not "changed".
- Takes the two versions from two running sites (`--before`, `--after`) or builds and serves them from a repository (`--base`, `--build`, `--serve`).
- Leaves out what is not stable: waits until a page has settled, visits it more than once, does not draw frames, compares an app shell and its content apart, and takes `--ignore` selectors.
- GitHub Action with a job summary and the video as an output.
